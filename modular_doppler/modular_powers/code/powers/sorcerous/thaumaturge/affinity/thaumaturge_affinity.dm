/* So, affinity is a system that applies a value to objects; and the amount of affinity is based on the item.
We have to apply this retroactively to existing items, which is what this file is for. If you make something new, include it as a var instead.

/*
A lot of Affinity asignments are vibe-based depending on looks, visibility and rarirty, but the rule of thumb I tend to use is;
- T1: If it goes in a weird slot (neck, mask, undersuit, shoes, gloves) OR if it has some association with 'magic' or pretending to be magical (e.g short capes) and isn't traditionally part of a classical caster archetype (Bard, Druid, Cleric, Wizard) it goes here.
- T2: Magical headwear with bonus stats (armor). Handheld affinity items that fit in pockets+. T1 equipment that covers a lot of the sprite (capes, full-head masks, etc.)
- T3: Magical headwear with NO bonus stats, Magical Bodywear with bonus stats. Rare magic-looking items in weird slots. Handheld affinity items that don't fit in pockets but do fit in the backpack.
- T4: Magical bodywear with NO bonus stats. Handheld affinity items that don't fit in pocket or backpack but allow suit slots/belt slot.
- T5: Handheld affinity items that don't fit anywhere (but the backpack). Most antag robes.
- T6+: Go with your gut based on rarity, looks and antag. Wiz robes are usually T7.
